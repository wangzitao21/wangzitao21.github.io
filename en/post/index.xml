&lt;p>However, the operator provides a dynamic IPv6 prefix of /56, which changes every few days, making it inconvenient to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are several countermeasures I tried.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The best way to solve dynamic IP is to use DDNS, which stands for Dynamic DNS. Here is the specific process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principles and Access Process of the SSH Protocol</title><link>https://wangzitao21.github.io/en/principles-and-access-process-of-the-ssh-protocol/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wangzitao21.github.io/en/principles-and-access-process-of-the-ssh-protocol/</guid><description>&lt;p>SSH stands for Secure Shell, which adds encryption to the shell. The common Linux server logins we encounter use SSH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, I used SSH without a clear understanding of its principles and specific steps. This time, I have systematically organized some information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this article is still relatively basic and may be further updated as my understanding deepens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Parts of this section refer to the following articles:&lt;/p>

Sometimes, I input a density value A, but the output density is B. Then, when I change the input density to B, the output density becomes C.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After repeatedly consulting the &lt;a href="https://www.phreeqcusers.org/">PHREEQC Users&lt;/a> forum, I have basically figured out the calculation logic of density. Here is my summary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="background">Background&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In PHREEQC, there are two units for measuring the mass of a liquid: &lt;code>kgw&lt;/code> and &lt;code>kgs&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Refresh Environment Variables Without Restarting Windows</title><link>https://wangzitao21.github.io/en/how-to-refresh-environment-variables-without-restarting-windows/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wangzitao21.github.io/en/how-to-refresh-environment-variables-without-restarting-windows/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the Windows system, sometimes when adding environment variables for some executable files, such as ffmpeg, modflow, etc., it usually requires a system restart to take effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, restarting often requires closing many ongoing tasks, which is very troublesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following steps can refresh environment variables without restarting the system:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Add the path of the program you need to add to the environment variables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open CMD and enter &lt;code>echo %Path%&lt;/code> to view the current environment variables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter &lt;code>set PATH=C:&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Close CMD and reopen it. Entering &lt;code>echo %Path%&lt;/code> again will show that the environment variables have been updated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item></channel></rss>
